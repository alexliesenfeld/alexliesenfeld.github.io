I am happy to announce my latest audio software project [*PumpStation*](https://www.pumpstation-plugin.com). It is an audio effect plug-in that you can add any modern [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation), such as [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/de/live/) or [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/de/logic-pro/). It lets you draw volume modulation curves and allows you to easily create interesting audio effects, such as simulated [sidechain compression](https://youtu.be/OqJ3oTSsNIk?t=129), [tremolo](https://youtu.be/oOCNB1izw8A?t=43), ducking, [gating, or stutter effects](https://youtu.be/g7WR9sPLJ_Y?t=287), and much more.

The name *PumpStation* refers to sidechain compression, which is sometimes also referred to as a "pumping" effect. It is available as a [VST3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology) and [AU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Au_file_format) audio plugin and supports macOS and Windows! The plugin is written in C++ using the wonderful [iPlug 2 framework](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2).

You can download it on its website at [www.pumpstation-plugin.com](https://www.pumpstation-plugin.com).
